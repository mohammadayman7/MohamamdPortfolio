    <h2>Applying for React Training</h2>
    <p> I am a computer science graduate with experience in building REST API's and CRUD operations using Spring Boot. I have also completed a 4-day bootcamp in React, but I am eager to further improve my skills in this area. Joining this training would not only help me to achieve my dream job as a React developer, but it would also provide me with the opportunity to start my career and expand my professional network. I am confident that this training will help me to develop the knowledge and skills I need to succeed in my field and I am excited about the prospect of being a part of the GazaSkyGeeks community."</p>
